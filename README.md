SPH
===

This is a parallel 2D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics(SPH) code designed to run in real time. The code is in active development but most of the time should compile and run on Raspbian and OS X. The code makes use of MPI for distributed computing and requires at least two mpi ranks(1 render, 1 compute). More documentation will follow.
