This is an SPH simulator modified to run on a RaspberryPi cluster.
It includes loadblanced MPI

TO DO:
compute density during neighbors search
shrink bucket size
store copies, not references, to particles in grid for better cache hit

for p in particles
	get hash cell C at point p
	if !c.done_already // process neighbor cells
	  for each p in C
	      search neighbor cells for q
		add q to p's neighbors
	      end
	      for k in C from (current p) to (num p in C)
		add k to p neighbors
	      end
	   end
	   c.done_already = true
