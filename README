This is an SPH simulator modified to run on a RaspberryPi cluster.
It includes loadblanced MPI

TO DO:
Remove boundary particles
Switch all computed quantities
Ensure efficient hash...which it is not currently
        can probably shrink some bucket sizes
	should checkf for duplicate hashes, not duplciate particles
	should use sort...probably
switch from double to float if possible
